The "topro" project (short for "topic proposer", sorry I wasn't very inspired on this) is a 
test that I made to play around with AngularJS. In the opposite to most of the AngularJS 
examples on the net, the project implements the entire chain: AngualarJS on the browser side, 
REST to communicate with the application server, JAX-RS/Jersey as server-side REST implementation, 
JSP as templating system of the server-side front-end, Java EE 6 for server-side back-end. 
The project demonstrates many different things, some of them are discussed in my blog at

Uses: Bootstrap, jQuery and AngularJS
